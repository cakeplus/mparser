mParser -- A simple monadic parser combinator library
=====================================================

This library implements a rather complete and efficient monadic
parser combinator library similar to the Parsec library for Haskell by Daan
Leijen and the FParsec library for F# by Stephan Tolksdorf.

mParser used to be a part of ocaml-base, a collection of useful OCaml
libraries by Holger Arnold [1].

It is possible to use mParser with pa_monad [2].


Requirements
------------

mParser depends on the following tools and libraries:

- Regular expression support relies on the PCRE-OCaml library [3].

- Compilation is done using OCamlBuild (which is included with OCaml and
  should compile this library starting from 3.12).

- Installation uses the Findlib library manager [4].


Installation
------------

Build the libraries (byte-code and native):

  $ make

Build the documentation:

  $ make docs

Install the library with findlib:

  $ make install

Uninstall the library with findlib:

  $ make uninstall
